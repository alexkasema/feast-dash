## Inspiration Behind FeastDash

The idea behind FeastDash was to create a food-ordering application that would serve as a foundation for gaining hands-on experience in developing a functional and scalable online ordering system. This project has equipped me with the knowledge and skills needed to create similar ordering applications that could be applied across various industries, including restaurants, retail, and services. With the expertise I've acquired through FeastDash, I aim to help small businesses establish online shops, making their offerings more accessible and increasing their revenue by tapping into a wider customer base.
